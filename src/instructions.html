		<h2>
			The rules of the game
		</h2>
		<p>
			Traversal is played on a rectangular board divided into squares. Some of the squares are empty, <br />
			while others contain "active" pieces.
		</p>
		<p id="p-img-1">
			<img src="../images/tvl_e.png" /> Empty square<br /><br />
			<img src="../images/tvl_p0.png" /> Wall, never moves<br /><br />
			<img src="../images/tvl_s.png" /> Player, moved by the user (keys on the keyboard)<br /><br />
			<img src="../images/tvl_t.png" /> Target, never moves<br />
		</p>

		<p>
			If the player is at the left (or right) edge of the board, moving left (or right) off the board has no <br />
			effect.In other words, the player cannot move beyond the left and right edge of the board. On the<br />
			other hand,if the player is at the top (or bottom) edge of the board, moving up (or down) makes<br />
			the player appear at the other edge.In other words, the player can wrap around the board from<br />
			the top to the bottom and vice versa.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Switchers
		</h2>
		<p>
			Switchers are active pieces that are either on or off. When they are on, the player is not allowed to<br />
			move onto them; "touching" them will end the round. When they are off, the player can move over<br />
			switchers. Switchers toggle between the on/off states based whenever the player moves.<br />
			Horizontal switchers toggle every time the player makes a horizontal move (either left or right);<br />
			vertical switchers toggle every time the player makes a vertical move (either up or down).<br />
		</p>

			<img src="../images/tvl_sh0.png" />	<img src="../images/tvl_sv0.png" />	Horizontal and vertical switchers in off state
		</p>

		<h2>
			Keys and ports
		</h2>
		<p>
			Ports are active pieces that are either open or closed. Keys are also active pieces. At the start of <br />
			a round, all keys are "available": when the player moves over a key, it toggles all of the ports on the <br />
			board between their open/closed states. In other words, all ports that are open, change to closed; all ports that are closed, <br />
			change to open. Once a key has toggled the ports, the key becomes <br />
			unavailable and can never toggle the ports again. The player is not allowed to move onto closed ports;<br />
			"touching" them will end the round. The player can move onto open ports.
		</p>

		</p>
		<h2>Walls</h2>
		<p>Walls remain stationary, "touching" them will end the round.</p>
